		<h1>Relaxation: Bora Bora, French Polynesia</h1>

		<br>
		<p>There is no more spectacular place on earth to relax than the lagoons of Bora Bora.  This island in the middle of the Pacific boasts reef after reef of abundant sea life.  Take an excursion to pet rays and see sharks, or suit up and go on an aqua safari.</p>
		<p>The overwater bungalow accommodations allow you to look through the window in the floor to see schools of fish, turtles, and even giant manta rays swimming below.  Hotel Bora Bora Nui is on the mainland, allowing nightly access to the famous Bora Bora restaurants.  And for those looking for freedom and serenity, the hotel provides kayaks and bikes to find your own personal slice of heaven.  Spend the day hiking the mainland, or kayak to a private motu and set up camp for the day.</p>
		<p>Package Includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>7 nights accommodation in an overwater bungalow at <a href="https://youtu.be/7Z19ujBkKLo">Hotel Le Maitai Bora Bora</a></li>
			<li>Daily Breakfast</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.aquasafaribora.com/en/">Aqua Safari</a> adventure</li>
			<li><a href="https://boraboraexplorer.com/tours/lagoon-snorkeling/">Shark and Ray Sightseeing</a> adventure</li>
			<li>Dinner at the famous <a href="https://www.bloodymarys.com/index.html">Bloody Mary's</a> in Bora Bora</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="advice">Advice:  Although staying on a private motu (island) may sound enticing, ensure you stay on the mainland to have the choice of dining options at night, and not be sequestered to the same high priced dinner menu at the resort dining area night after night.</p>

		<h1>Culture: Machu Picchu, Peru</h1>

		<img class="imageGallery" src="windowOfMachu.jpg">
		<br>
		<p>Take a step back in time to the ancient Incan village of Machu Picchu.  This vacation is just as much about the journey as the destination.  Fly into the Spanish town of Cusco and admire high altitude colonialism at its finest.  Then hop a train to wind through the Andes to arrive at the town of Aguas Calientes, at the base of Machu Picchu.  At dawn, take a winding bus ride up the side of a steep cliff to Machu Picchu park.  Choose to watch alpaca graze between terraced ruins, or make your way to the famous hilltop of Huayna Picchu to hike to the most spectacular view in South America.</p>
		<p>Accommodations make you feel the part.  Courtyards lead to private 2 story suites.  These ancient buildings don’t even come with central heating, so be sure to grab a space heater and snuggle under down blankets as the fresh alpine air chills the outside world.  Amazing dinners can include the more traditional or try a Peruvian delicacy, such as Alpaca or Guinea Pig.</p>
		<p>Package Includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>3 nights at <a href="https://tierravivahoteles.com/tierra-viva-cusco-centro/">the Tierra Viva Cusco Central</a> in Cusco</li>
			<li>Continental Breakfast at the hotel daily</li>
			<li>Day Trip to the Incan Ruins above Cusco</li>
			<li>Train transfer to Aguas Calientes</li>
			<li>2 nights at <a href="https://www.inkaterra.com/byinkaterra/el-mapi-hotel/the-experience/">the El Mapi Hotel Machu Picchu</a> in Aguas Calientes</li>
			<li>Train Return to Cusco</li>
			<li>1 night at <a href="http://www.antiguacusco.com/"> Antigua Casona San Blas</a> in Cusco</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="advice">Advice: Be sure to try the “coka” tea in Cusco.  It is an Peruvian favorite that legend says combats altitude sickness.</p>
