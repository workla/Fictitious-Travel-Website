# Fictitious-Travel-Website

This website was a project to practice JavaScript, HTML and CSS coding skills.
The fictional travel company was made to practice forms, slideshows, and Javascript manipulation of the user experience.

Future Plans include developing the backend to accept and process requests and interact with a backend database, and an update of the website design to a more modern feel.
