# Travel-Website-Prototype

• Focus on JavaScript manipulation of user experience including forms, menus, and slideshows
• HTML and CSS concepts to design cohesive website - each page has a theme, skill, or concept utilized to practice multiple coding techniques

Future Plans include developing the backend to accept and process requests and interact with a backend database, and an update of the website design to a more modern feel.
