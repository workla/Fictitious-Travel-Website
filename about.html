		<h1>About Foxglove Adventures</h1>
		<img src="laurenAndEric.jpg" class="textWrapHeader">
		<p>Foxglove Adventures was founded in 2019 by Lauren and Eric Work.  The website spawned from the idea of having a <i>friend</i> in the travel industry, someone who could steer you to the hole in the wall location that nobody writes about.  Foxglove was born to be a boutique travel experience, where you get a friendly insider perspective and a unique experience.</p>

			<h2>About Lauren</h2>
			
			<p>Lauren grew up in Marin County, California.  Her educational mentors often taught core subjects by showing world examples.  This spurred her first interest in travel.</p>
			<p>Lauren believes that everyone either has the time or the money to travel, but rarely both.  So her motto has always been <strong>smart travel</strong>.  Often she chose where she was going based on where the deals were.  This meant scouring for unique locations and then monitoring price changes for years, before hopping on deals at the drop of a hat.  Some of her best finds include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Stay at a luxury hotel in Cambodia with daily breakfast and massages for $18/night</li>
				<li>Staying at Disney's Aulani for 35% of their cheapest available room, with upgrades of free parking and ocean view included</li>
				<li>Booking a package for two weeks in Kenya and Tanzania, including daily safaris, hotels, food, and all transports for the advertised cost of airfare alone.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Travelling smart doesn't mean you have to sacrifice quality or experiences.  It simply means putting the time into recognizing a deal, and being flexible.  Lauren's goal with starting Foxglove Adventures was to offer the travel expertise that took decades to cultivate.</p>

			<h2>About Eric</h2>
			
			<p>Eric grew up in Vancouver, Washington.  His mother is an immigrant from Nicaragua, so Eric spent his childhood visiting with family across Central America.  This family history left Eric with a sense that children, even young children, should not be the reason a family chooses not to travel.  Some of Eric's best times as a child were travelling to other cultures.</p>
			<p>So, when Eric and Lauren started a family themselves, it was natural that the kids were going to be travelers as well.  Some of the locations the Work family has travelled with young children:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>France, Germany, Austria, and Italy with a 1 year old, including:
					<ul>
						<li>a 10 hour plane ride direct from SFO to CDG</li>
						<li>10-12 hour days sightseeing</li>
						<li>Finding alternative sites that accommodated infants, such as a salt mine tour outside Salzburg</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Dubai with a 2 year old and 9 month old, including:
					<ul>
						<li>a 15 hour plane flight direct from SFO to DXB
						<li>Taxi, Boat, and Bus Service for families</li>
						<li>Sightseeing without a stroller</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Costa Rica with a 4 year old and 2 year old, including:
					<ul>
						<li>Multi-Leg overnight flights with children</li>
						<li>Boat trips from the resort to nearby beaches</li>
						<li>Hotels and Inns particularly accommodating to infants</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Eric hopes to pass tips and tricks on to other families, so that more experience travel in the early years of a child's life.  In fact, there are quite a few things that are easier to see and do with toddlers, as opposed to teenagers!</p>
